   // A)  Exceptions are needed in multiple situations in Java coding. Describe what an Exception is and give a written
    // description of when one might be needed in a program.

    // Answer

   /* An exception is Java’s way of saying, “I give up. I don’t know what to do right now. You
    deal with it.” When you write a method, you can either deal with the exception or make it
    the calling code’s problem.*/
